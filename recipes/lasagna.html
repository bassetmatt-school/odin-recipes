    <h3 id="-description-"><strong>Description:</strong></h3>
    <p>
        Dive into the culinary unknown with <em>Quantum Banana Lasagna</em>, where the boundaries between dessert and
        dinner collapse like a failed science experiment. This chaotic fusion of sweet, savory, and pure confusion
        guarantees your guests will talk about it for years — whether that&#39;s positive or not remains... uncertain.

    <h2 id="-ingredients-"><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ripe bananas (preferably wearing sunglasses for extra flavor)</li>
        <li>1 jar of spicy marinara sauce (bonus points if it&#39;s sentient)</li>
        <li>500g pre-cooked lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>200g shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>100g crushed nacho chips (the loud crunch is essential)</li>
        <li>1 small rubber duck (for garnish, strictly non-edible)</li>
        <li>½ cup pickled onions</li>
        <li>A sprinkle of existential dread (optional but traditional)</li>
        <li>1 pair of oven mitts that look like lobster claws (for morale)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="-step-by-step-guide-"><strong>Step-by-Step Guide:</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Step 1: Preheat the oven</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat your oven to exactly <strong>374°F</strong> — not 375°F, or the bananas might start philosophizing.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Step 2: Prepare the banana layer</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Peel the bananas dramatically, slice them lengthwise, and coat them lightly with maple syrup while
            whispering your deepest secrets to them. This enhances flavor.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Step 3: Assemble the lasagna</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>In a large baking dish, alternate layers in the following order: lasagna noodles, spicy marinara, sliced
            bananas, mozzarella cheese, pickled onions, crushed nachos. Repeat until you&#39;re questioning your life
            choices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Step 4: The Crunch Factor</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Top the final layer with an aggressive amount of crushed nacho chips. The goal is to achieve a texture
            somewhere between &quot;crispy&quot; and &quot;mildly dangerous.&quot;</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Step 5: Bake to Quantum Perfection</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bake uncovered for <strong>26 minutes and 43 seconds</strong>. If you hear faint whispers from the oven,
            that&#39;s normal.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Step 6: Garnish with Chaos</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove from oven wearing your lobster claw oven mitts. Place the small rubber duck proudly in the center as
            a garnish.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Step 7: Serve with Confidence</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Slice and serve while maintaining direct eye contact with your guests. Offer extra maple syrup for
            drizzling. Apologize profusely or accept compliments — reactions will vary.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Quantum Banana Lasagna pairs well with sparkling water, confusion, and an existential crisis for
            dessert.</em></p>
    <p>Would you like an equally absurd beverage to go with it?</p>
