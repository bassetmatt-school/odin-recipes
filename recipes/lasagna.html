    <h3 id="-description-"><strong>Description:</strong></h3>
    <p>
        Dive into the culinary unknown with <em>Quantum Banana Lasagna</em>, where the boundaries between dessert and
        dinner collapse like a failed science experiment. This chaotic fusion of sweet, savory, and pure confusion
        guarantees your guests will talk about it for years — whether that&#39;s positive or not remains... uncertain.

    <ul>
        <li>3 ripe bananas (preferably wearing sunglasses for extra flavor)</li>

        <li>200g shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
        <li>100g crushed nacho chips (the loud crunch is essential)</li>
        <li>1 small rubber duck (for garnish, strictly non-edible)</li>
        <li>½ cup pickled onions</li>
        <li>A sprinkle of existential dread (optional but traditional)</li>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Preheat the oven</strong></p>
            Preheat your oven to exactly <strong>374°F</strong> — not 375°F, or the bananas might start philosophizing.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p><strong>Prepare the banana layer</strong></p>

            Peel the bananas dramatically, slice them lengthwise, and coat them lightly with maple syrup while
            whispering your deepest secrets to them. This enhances flavor.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p><strong>Assemble the lasagna</strong></p>

            In a large baking dish, alternate layers in the following order: lasagna noodles, spicy marinara, sliced
            bananas, mozzarella cheese, pickled onions, crushed nachos. Repeat until you&#39;re questioning your life
            choices.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p><strong>The Crunch Factor</strong></p>

            Top the final layer with an aggressive amount of crushed nacho chips. The goal is to achieve a texture
            somewhere between &quot;crispy&quot; and &quot;mildly dangerous.&quot;
        </li>

        <li>
            <p><strong>Bake to Quantum Perfection</strong></p>
            Bake uncovered for <strong>26 minutes and 43 seconds</strong>. If you hear faint whispers from the oven,
            that&#39;s normal.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p><strong>Garnish with Chaos</strong></p>
            Remove from oven wearing your lobster claw oven mitts. Place the small rubber duck proudly in the center as
            a garnish.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p><strong>Serve with Confidence</strong></p>
            Slice and serve while maintaining direct eye contact with your guests. Offer extra maple syrup for
            drizzling.
            Apologize profusely or accept compliments — reactions will vary.
        </li>
    </ol>
