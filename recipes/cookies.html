            <p>
                Head to your backyard, park, or neighbor's lawn with confidence. Snip approximately one cup of the
                freshest,
                greenest grass you can find. Gently scoop up half a cup of rich, crumbly dirt. Avoid worm-heavy patches
                unless
                you're feeling <em>really</em> rustic.
            </p>

        <li>
            <h3 id="2-prepare-your-base-"><strong>Prepare Your Base</strong></h3>
            <p>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until fluffy, contemplating your life
                choices.
                Add
                eggs
                and vanilla, mixing until smooth and almost resembling a real cookie batter.
            </p>

        <li>
            <h3 id="3-incorporate-nature-"><strong>Incorporate Nature</strong></h3>
            <p>Sift the flour and baking soda together. Gradually fold it into the mixture, then stir in the grass and
                dirt.
                Embrace
                the crunch and earthy aroma wafting up from the bowl — that's authenticity.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Sprinkles? Sure. Glitter? Absolutely. Tiny pebbles? Bold move, but you're already making dirt cookies,
                so why stop now?
            </p>

            </h3>
            <p>
                Scoop dollops of the mixture onto a baking sheet, spacing them out because these cookies need
                <em>room to grow</em>.
                Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 12–15 minutes, or until the edges are golden and your kitchen
                smells faintly offreshlymowed lawns and regret.

                Let cool on a wire rack. Garnish with extra blades of grass for presentation. Serve to unsuspecting
                friends,
                preferably with a disclaimer.
