    <p>
        Forget everything you thought you knew about dessert—or vegetables. The <em>Flamingo Eggplant Sundae</em> boldly
        blends creamy ice cream with roasted eggplant, pink sprinkles, and a sense of bewilderment. Simultaneously
        refreshing and unnerving, this chaotic confection turns heads and stomachs alike. Perfect for dinner parties,
        protests, or existential spirals.

        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Roast the Eggplant</strong>
            </p>
            Preheat your oven to <strong>392°F</strong>, precisely. Slice the eggplant into thick rings, roast for 15
            minutes, then let cool. Yes, you will be putting ice cream on these later.
        </li>

            <p>
                <strong>Pinkify Everything</strong>
            </p>
            While the eggplant cools, cover your preparation area in pink decorations. Bonus points if your outfit also
            looks like a flamingo&#39;s nightmare.
        </li>

                <strong>Sundae Assembly</strong>
            </p>
            Place roasted eggplant slices in a dessert bowl. Top each with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Drizzle hot
            fudge over the ice cream. Don’t panic, this is normal.
        </li>

            <p>
                <strong>Add the Magic</strong>
            </p>
            Cover generously with rainbow sprinkles, edible glitter, and a disturbing amount of whipped cream. Sprinkle
            cinnamon lightly for a hint of &quot;what is happening?&quot;
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Garnish with Dignity</strong>
            </p>
            Place the plastic lawn flamingo next to the bowl or directly into the dessert for maximum social confusion.
        </li>
        <li>

            <p>
                <strong>Serve with Soundtrack</strong>
            </p>
            Hand out kazoos to guests. Everyone must play a note before eating. Tradition demands it.
        </li>

    <p>
        Pairs well with sparkling rosé, bewildered stares, and light identity crises. Do not question why this
        exists—embrace the chaos.
